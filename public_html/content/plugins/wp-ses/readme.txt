WP-SES redirects all outgoing WordPress emails through Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) for maximum email delivrability.

== Description ==

WP-SES redirects All outgoing WordPress emails through Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) instead of local wp_mail function.
This ensures high email delivrability, email trafic statistics and a powerful managed infrastructure.

This plugin is functionnal and I use it on several websites.
WPMU features are so far experimental.

Current features are:

*	Ability to adjust WordPress Default Sender Email and Name
*	Validation of Amazon API Credentials
*	Request confirmation for sender Emails
*	Test message within Amazon Sandbox mode
*	Full integration as seamless replacement for wp_mail internal function
*	Dasboard panel with Quota and statistics
*	Ability to customize return path for delivery failure notifications
*       Custom Reply-To or from Headers
*       Default config values for centralised WPMU setups
*       SES Endpoint selection       

See full features at http://wp-ses.com/features.html

Roadmap

*	Graphical SES Statistics
*	Full featured Error management
*	Control of sending rate
*	Notice for volume limits
*	Bounce and blacklist management
