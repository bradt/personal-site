The most effective way to promote your WordPress content.

== Description ==

You write great content, but it can get lost in the fast-moving world of social media. Post Promoter Pro makes sure your content is seen - it enables you to schedule repeat posts to social media once it has been published.

Engage followers who may have missed the original post; Post Promoter Pro allows you to customize the text that sits before the link to your content. Experiment with hashtags, a call to action, or interesting text that starts a conversation and compels your followers to view your post.
