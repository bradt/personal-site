		<p>I was born an entrepreneur. From lemonade stands and mowing lawns, to
		making my first dollars online, I've always been motivated by
		entrepreneurship. In June 2002, I cofounded <a title="Zenutech"
		href="http://www.zenutech.ca/">a web hosting company</a> 
		that's still
		going strong today. I currently work full time on a new venture
		started in October 2011 called <a 
		href="http://deliciousbrains.com">Delicious Brains</a>.</p>

		<p>Before that, I built web sites for a living. I worked as an
		independent, most often collaborating with a creative agency or an
		independent web designer. I hardly ever did design myself because I
		had too many talented designer friends who were much better at it. But
		because I can design and have a programming background, my strength
		lies in frontend web development. Most projects also involved my <abbr
		title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> of choice, WordPress.</p>

		<p><strong>I love to travel.</strong> Most recently I've been a
		tourist in Jamaica, Cuba, NYC, Boston, New Zealand, Tasmania (Australia),
		Malaysia, and China. I can hardly wait to visit South America and
		Eastern Europe.</p>

		<p>I grew up in <a title="Photo: My Backyard"
		href="http://dev.bradt.ca/photo-set/cape-breton/ol-backyard-cape-
		breton-ns-2/">beautiful, rural Cape Breton, Canada</a>. But I find
		cities wonderful. I've lived in both Vancouver and Melbourne. They
		truly are <a
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World's_most_livable_cities">the
		most liveable cities</a> on the planet. I miss them both. Today, my
		wife Carolyn, son Max, and I call Halifax, Canada home.</p>

		<p><strong>I love sports.</strong> I play beer league hockey in the
		winter, golf and <a
		href="http://redcircus.brokenultimate.com">competitive ultimate
		frisbee</a> in the summer.</p>

		<p>I've had a personal web site since 1996 but only started blogging
		in 2004. This site is now mainly geared toward my professional career,
		showcasing my work and publishing my original writings about the
		business of building the web. I also share short thoughts on <a
		href="http://twitter.com/bradt">Twitter</a> and 
		<a href="https://plus.google.com/103798016457548612622">Google+</a>
		and post code to <a href="https://github.com/bradt">GitHub</a> and 
		<a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/bradt">WordPress.org</a>.</p>

		<p>This site is powered by a custom WordPress theme developed in Sublime 
		Text 2 and running on an Amazon Web Services.</p>
